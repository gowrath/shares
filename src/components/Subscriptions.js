        A friend mentions they have Netflix. 
        <br />
        <br />
        An awkward moment ensues.
        <br />
        <br />
        'You did? How come you didn't tell me?'
        <br />
        <br />
        *Friend tries their best to explain*
        <br />
        <br />
        Assuming you're not a psychopath, you would like to share 'subs' with your friend. 
        <br />
