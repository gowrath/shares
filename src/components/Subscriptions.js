            A friend mentions they have Netflix. 
            <br />
            <br />
            An awkward moment ensues.
            <br />
            <br />
            'You did? How come you didn't tell me?'
            <br />
            <br />
            *Friend tries their best to explain*
            <br />
            <br />
            Assuming you're not a psychopath, you would like to share 'subs' with your friend.
