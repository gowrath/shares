# Share Subscriptions

Digital subscriptions are ubiqitous. So is overpaying for them while a friend has one you need. Why not take advantage of 'friends and family' sharing policies of such services? Sharesub is the solution to this problem.

It is: 

1) A site to share information with friends about the subscriptions you have.
2) A portal to share the latest hot TV show or movie (sort by relevance and topical)
