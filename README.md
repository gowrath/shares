# Share Subscriptions

This is a tool built in the React framework to help you manage, calculate and add the cost of your monthly subscriptions. 

Digital subscriptions are ubiqitous. So is overpaying for them while a friend has one you need. Why not take advantage of 'friends and family' sharing policies of such services? Sharesub is the solution to this problem.

It is: 

1) A site to share information with friends about the subscriptions you have and they do not.
2) A portal service to share the latest hot TV show or movie (sort by relevance and topical).
3) A cost calculator to figure out how much you are spending per month. 

The cost calculator is a web scraper from the various subscription websites: Netflix, HBO, Disney Plus.

1. React Hooks
2. React-Router (v.5; still uses Switch instead of Routes)
